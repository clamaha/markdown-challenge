            <h5>A funny story</h5>
              <p>It happened on the bus a few weeks ago. I was standing because the bus was crowded and an old man stood in front of me. I noticed he looked at me too much and even laughed sometimes. After a while there was more space in the bus so he came closer and told me that I looked like Columbo (I was wearing a beige trench coat) and that‚Äôs why he was laughing. He started saying Columbo catchwords and I didn‚Äôt understand anything because I never watched this tv show. He noticed I was a little embarrassed so he just left and got out of the bus. I guess I‚Äôll never wear that trench again‚Ä¶</p>
